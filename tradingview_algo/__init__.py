"""
TradingView Algo Dev â€“ modular utilities extracted from `data_processing.py`.

This package provides a clean, typed, and documented interface for the data
processing, indicator calculations, and alert transformations that were
previously embedded in a single monolithic script.

The original file `data_processing.py` is left untouched. Use these modules
to build new pipelines or incrementally move logic into maintainable units.
