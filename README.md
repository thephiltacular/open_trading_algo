# open_trading_algo

A comprehensive Python library for algorithmic trading, technical analysis, and financial data processing. Built for performance, reliability, and ease of use in both research and production environments.

The overall goal is to get as much value as possible without paying for api access ;)
This means managing API query rates, storing as much data as possible locally, and leveraging multiple APIs to get the data we need.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thephiltacular/open_trading_algo.git
cd open_trading_algo
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from open_trading_algo.fin_data_apis.fetchers import fetch_yahoo
from open_trading_algo.indicators.indicators import calculate_rsi
from open_trading_algo.indicators.long_signals import rsi_oversold_signal

# Fetch current market data
data = fetch_yahoo(["AAPL", "GOOGL"], ["price", "volume"])
print(f"AAPL: ${data['AAPL']['price']:.2f}")

# Technical analysis with historical data
import yfinance as yf

df = yf.Ticker("AAPL").history(period="6mo")

# Calculate RSI and generate signals
rsi = calculate_rsi(df["Close"])
signals = rsi_oversold_signal(df["Close"])

print(f"Current RSI: {rsi.iloc[-1]:.2f}")
print(f"Active signals: {signals.sum()}")
```

## Automated Local Database Setup

open_trading_algo uses a persistent, efficient SQLite database to cache and store all financial data locally. This ensures:
- Minimal requests to external APIs (prevents throttling)
- Fast repeated access to historical and live data
- Data is retained even if the host is shut down

### How It Works

* On first use, the database is automatically created in the project directory as `open_trading_algo/tv_data_cache.sqlite3`.
* All data fetches (live, enrichment, backtest) check the local database first. Only missing data is requested from yfinance or other sources.
* New data is automatically stored in the database for future use.
* The database is managed by the `DataCache` class in `open_trading_algo/data_cache.py`.

### Custom Database Path

If you want to use a custom database location or a remote database, create a `db_config.yaml` file in the project root:

```yaml
db_path: /path/to/your/database.sqlite3
```

All modules will use this path automatically if the config file is present.

### Automated Setup

The database is set up automatically on first use. To manually initialize or verify the database, run:

```bash
python scripts/setup_db.py
```

This will create the database and all required tables if they do not exist.


### Signal Caching: Avoid Recomputing Signals

open_trading_algo caches all computed signals (long, short, options, sentiment) for each ticker, timeframe, and signal type. This means:
- Signals are only computed once per unique (ticker, timeframe, signal_type) combination.
- All signal modules (`long_signals.py`, `short_signals.py`, `options_signals.py`, `sentiment_signals.py`) are integrated with the cache.
- On repeated runs, signals are loaded instantly from the database.

#### Example Usage

```python
from open_trading_algo.cache.data_cache import DataCache
import pandas as pd

# Suppose you have a DataFrame `signals_df` with datetime index and a 'signal_value' column
signals_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"signal_value": [1, 0, 1]},
    index=pd.to_datetime(["2023-01-01", "2023-01-02", "2023-01-03"]),
)

cache = DataCache()
cache.store_signals("AAPL", "1d", "long_trend", signals_df)

# Retrieve cached signals
df = cache.get_signals("AAPL", "1d", "long_trend")
print(df)

# Check if signals are cached
exists = cache.has_signals("AAPL", "1d", "long_trend")
print("Signals cached:", exists)
```

#### In Signal Modules

Each signal module provides a `compute_and_cache_*_signals` function:

```python
from open_trading_algo.long_signals import compute_and_cache_long_signals

signals_df = compute_and_cache_long_signals("AAPL", price_df, "1d")
```

This pattern is used for all signal types (long, short, options, sentiment).

### Notes

- The database is SQLite for maximum portability and zero setup. For advanced users, you can point `db_path` to a remote or cloud SQLite file.
- If you ever want to reset the cache, simply delete the `.sqlite3` file and it will be recreated on next use.
